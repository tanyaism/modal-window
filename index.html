      <h1>The largest number of vegetarians in the world 🥔🥕🥒🍅</h1>
      <p>
        In the list of unknown facts about India, this is not very widely known.
        India is home to the largest number of vegetarians in the world.
        Religion is the main motivation behind vegetarianism in India, with over
        81% of the adult population refraining from eating meat on certain days.
        Also, a vast majority of the Jain and Buddhist population in India avoid
        eating meat and follow a plant-based diet. It would not be a surprise to
        come across vegetarian KFC and McDonald’s menus in India, among other
        global food chains.
