# modal-window

In user interface design for computer applications, a modal window is a graphical control element subordinate to an application's main window.

A modal window creates a mode that disables user interaction with the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent window.
